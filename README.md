This is a BDD Test framework for the Github API created around Gherkin and Cucumber-JVM

Requirements: 
------------
- The JDK 8+ must be installed
- Maven must be installed
- You must have a github account
- Create and copy a Personal Access Token on Github granting all necessary authorizations (at least gist and repo for these tests) => https://github.com/settings/tokens

The API limits the number of requests it can respond to in a day. The limit is much lower for unauthenticated requests.
For that reason, even for calls that don't require authentication, it is recommended to use a client Token or basic username and password either in the pom or in command-line when running the tests.

How to run the tests:
------------
Recommended:
 
	Create a Personal Access Token on Github granting all authorization => https://github.com/settings/tokens
	Edit the pom.xml to set your Personal Access Token and username then save
	mvn clean test

Or:

	Create a Personal Access Token on Github granting all authorization => https://github.com/settings/tokens
	mvn clean test -Dclient.token=[PASTEYOURTOKENHERE] -Dclient.username=[YOURUSERNAME]


Not recommended - if you don't have a Personal Access Token (some tests can fail depending on your github security settings):

	Edit the pom.xml to set the client.token to empty, set your username and password then save
	mvn clean test
 
 Or:
 
 	mvn clean test -Dclient.token= -Dclient.username=[YOURUSERNAME] -Dclient.password=[YOURPASSWORD]
    
  /!\  Leaving client token and username empty will run the tests as unauthenticated. Some tests will fail.

Tests reports:
------------

The test report generated by Cucumber JVM is in HTML format and can be found post execution in target/cucumber/index.html.
Additionnally surefire generates an XML JUnit report in target/surefire-reports that CI Servers usually love.
